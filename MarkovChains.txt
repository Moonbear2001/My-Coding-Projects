Markov Chains

This project uses Markov Chains to predict changes to a "stock market"
The results of the calculations are displayed in a histogram and a line graph.

This project predicts the behavior of stocks in the stock market. 
It first builds a model using Markov Chains of a particular stock's (or stock index's) behavior based on past performance. 
The model is then used to predict what the stock's price will do (go up a little/lot, go down a little/lot) 
for the next few days in the future.
