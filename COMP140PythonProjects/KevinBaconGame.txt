Kevin Bacon Game

This game is also known as the "Siz Degrees of Kavin Bacon", a game based on the concept of 6 degrees
of separation.  This concept suggests that any two people in the world are 6 or fewer links apart.  In
this game, links are based on actors that have starred in movies together.

An example of the game can be found here:
