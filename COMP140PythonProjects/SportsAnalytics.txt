Sports Analytics

This program predicts the outcome of baseball seasons using 122 different statistics.
The problem is solved using matrices.  A linear model is used to characterize the relationship between
statistics and the number of wins.  We attempt to express our measured variable, the number of wins,
as a weighted sum of our explanatory variables.

My implementation of the program can be found here:
