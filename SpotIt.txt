Projective Geometry

This project uses projective geometry to implement a game called Spot it.  
An example of this game can be found at: http://www.blueorangegames.com/spotit/

The object of the game is that given any two cards, they will contain one matching image.
The player has to find the image as fast as possible.

My implementation of the game can be accessed at the following link:
